The solution involves refactoring the CSS to avoid the use of `!important`.  Here are a couple of possible approaches:

**Approach 1:  Increased Specificity**

Increase the specificity of the parent selector by adding another class or ID to make it more specific than `.child`

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}

.parent.specific .child {
  color: green;
}
```

**Approach 2: CSS Cascade**

Reorder the CSS rules so the intended style is declared later.  CSS cascade will ensure that the last matching selector is applied.

```css
.parent {
  color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: green;
}

.child {
  color: red;
}
```

It's generally recommended to avoid `!important` whenever possible. It can make CSS harder to maintain and debug.
